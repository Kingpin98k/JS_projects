# TourPackageApi

This is an API that I am building for a simple tour booking site developed using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. References have been taken from Jonas.io's Nodejs Course.

## The Site is now Live

The tour booking site is now live at [tour-package-project.onrender.com](https://tour-package-project.onrender.com).
